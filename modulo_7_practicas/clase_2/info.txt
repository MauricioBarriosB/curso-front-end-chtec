user stories for a hospital website project using React JS and MySQL. The requirements are authentication system, maintaining doctors, patients, and medical appointments. They mentioned using INVEST and SMART models from Scrum. Let me start by recalling what INVEST and SMART stand for.

INVENT criteria for user stories: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable. SMART goals: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound. So each user story should meet both sets of criteria.

First, list out the main features: authentication, doctors, patients, appointments. Let's break each into user stories. For authentication, maybe registration, login, roles, password recovery. For doctors, CRUD operations. Same for patients. Appointments would include scheduling, viewing, canceling, maybe a calendar.

I need to make sure each story is independent. For example, creating a doctor shouldn't depend on another story. They should be valuable to the user. Also, each should be testable, like having clear acceptance criteria.

Prioritization: Typically, authentication is foundational because other features depend on it. Then, maybe patients and doctors since you need them before appointments. But the user might prioritize based on business value. However, logically, you can't schedule an appointment without doctors and patients. So the order might be authentication → doctors → patients → appointments.

Wait, but the user might need to have all maintainers (doctors, patients) before appointments. So the priority could be:

1. Authentication (high)

2. Doctors (high)

3. Patients (high)

4. Appointments (medium)

5. Additional features like calendar view, reports (low)

But need to confirm. Also, maybe the registration and login are part of the first sprint. Then, creating doctors and patients. Then appointments.

Each user story should be written from the user's perspective. For example, "As an admin, I want to create doctor profiles so that..." etc.

Applying SMART: Each story should have specific acceptance criteria, measurable (like form validation), achievable within a sprint, relevant to the project, and time-bound (estimated time).

Now, structuring each story with title, description, acceptance criteria, INVEST/SMART check, priority.

Need to check if all INVEST criteria are met. For example, if a story is too big, break it down. Like "Create mantenedor for doctors" could be broken into Create, Read, Update, Delete separate stories? But maybe the user grouped them as one. Wait, the user said "mantenedor" which is a CRUD system, so maybe each CRUD operation is a separate story. That way they are smaller and more manageable.

So, for doctors:

- As an admin, I can add a new doctor.

- As an admin, I can view the list of doctors.

- As an admin, I can edit a doctor's info.

- As an admin, I can delete a doctor.

Same for patients. Then for appointments: schedule, view, edit, cancel.

Authentication: register, login, recover password, assign roles.

This breakdown makes each story smaller and more INVEST-compliant.

Prioritization order could be:

1. User registration and login (authentication is needed for other features)

2. CRUD for doctors (since appointments need doctors)

3. CRUD for patients (appointments need patients)

4. CRUD for appointments

5. Additional features like calendar view, reports

But the user might need to have all CRUD operations for each entity as separate stories. However, maybe grouping them per entity is okay as long as each story is small enough.

Wait, for example, creating a doctor's form might be one story, but maybe adding the entire CRUD for doctors is too big. However, given the scope, perhaps each CRUD for an entity is a single story. Let's check.

If "As an admin, I want to manage doctors (CRUD)" is one story, is it too big? It might be, but maybe for the initial phase, it's manageable. Alternatively, split into separate stories. The user needs to decide, but since the user is asking for help, perhaps splitting into separate CRUD operations for clarity and better estimation.

But the user might prefer grouped stories. Hmm. Let me see the example in the previous answer. The assistant previously grouped CRUD into one story per entity. For example, "Creación y gestión de doctores (CRUD)" as one story. But according to INVEST, it's better to split them. However, maybe for the sake of simplicity, group them, but ensure they are still small enough.

Alternatively, maybe split into Create, Read, Update, Delete. But that could lead to too many stories. Let me check the INVEST criteria: Small. Each story should be small enough to be completed in a sprint. If the CRUD for doctors can be done in a sprint, maybe it's okay. Otherwise, split.

Assuming the project is manageable, perhaps group them as one story per entity's CRUD. Then, the priority would be as follows:

1. Authentication (High)

2. CRUD Doctors (High)

3. CRUD Patients (High)

4. CRUD Appointments (Medium)

5. Calendar view (Low)

6. Reports (Low)

But the exact priority might vary. For example, maybe after authentication, creating patients is higher than doctors, but typically both are needed for appointments.

Additionally, the authentication story should include role-based access (admin, patient, doctor), which is important for security.

Also, password recovery is part of authentication.

So, the user stories would be:

Authentication:

- User registration with roles

- Login

- Password recovery

- Logout

Doctors CRUD:

- Create doctor

- Read doctor list

- Update doctor

- Delete doctor

Similarly for Patients.

Appointments:

- Schedule appointment

- View appointments

- Cancel appointment

- Edit appointment (maybe)

Additional features:

- Calendar view

- Reports

Now, writing each as a user story with INVEST and SMART criteria.

For example, the first story could be:

Title: User Registration with Role Assignment

As a new user, I want to register with my email and password and select my role (admin, doctor, patient) so that I can access the system according to my permissions.

ACs:

1. Registration form with email, password, role dropdown (admin, doctor, patient).

2. Email validation (format).

3. Password requirements (min 8 chars, mix of letters and numbers).

4. Store data in MySQL.

5. Success message and redirect to login.

INVEST Check:

- Independent: Yes, doesn't depend on others.

- Negotiable: Details can be discussed (like password rules).

- Valuable: Provides access.

- Estimable: Yes, backend and frontend work.

- Small: Yes.

- Testable: Yes, via form submission tests.

SMART Check:

- Specific: Yes, form fields and validation.

- Measurable: Form validation implemented.

- Achievable: Yes with React and MySQL.

- Relevant: Core feature.

- Time-bound: Estimate 2-3 days.

Priority: High (1)

Then, similar for other stories.

Prioritization order would be:

1. Authentication stories (registration, login, recovery)

2. CRUD Doctors

3. CRUD Patients

4. CRUD Appointments

5. Additional features

Each CRUD for doctors and patients would be separate stories, but grouped under their mantenedor. Maybe each CRUD operation is a separate story for better granularity.

But to save time, perhaps group them as one story per entity's CRUD, but ensure they meet INVEST. If the CRUD for doctors is too big, split into create, read, update, delete.

In any case, the key is to ensure each story is INVEST-compliant and SMART.

Now, structuring all this into a coherent answer with prioritized user stories, each with title, description, acceptance criteria, INVEST/SMART check, and priority.
